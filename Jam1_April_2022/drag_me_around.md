# 2022 Game Jam submission: Drag Me aROUND.

Not really a game, as it has no gameplay component to it. I'd call this submission an interactive toy.

The player's objective is to drag a "thing" around, watch it wiggle, and gain some score.

# Interpretation of Theme

I had in my mind an actual side-scroll platformer that would interpret the theme quite nicely. 
Unfortunately, I did not have enought time to invest into this game jam. Maybe next time.

I managed to write a simple physics engine that was meant to be used as the basis for the
game mechanics. This engine is not finished yet. For example, it does not support collisions yet.

The integration test I created, allowed me to drag a thingy around. So... I decided that this
could be a clever hack on my part, "Drag the thing a**round**". The thing being dragged is somewhat
round as well :^)
