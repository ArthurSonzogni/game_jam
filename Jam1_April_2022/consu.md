# 2022 Game Jam submission: Consu

Consu is a music clicker game. The target is to click circles - in the correct timing of course - while listening to your favourite music!
It includes built in level maker - listen to your music while clicking on canvas to create a map you can play later on!

Circles are round... click round objects to win...

# Other Things You Want To Share

This project was fun enough I am most likely going to develop it in the future.
Already planned:
- adding new modes (rainbow mode / speedrun mode / free clicking mode / keyboard gamemode / typing mode)
- fix mouse events (sometimes it registers one click as several ones...)
- improve UI and UX
- make it work for MacOS (for now sound library doesn't work there)
