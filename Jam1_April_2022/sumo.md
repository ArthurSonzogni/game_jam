# Interpretation of Theme

We were brainstorming ideas and at some point we were joking about cats pushing objects out of a round flat earth.

From there we thought about "pushing outside a circle" and landed on a sumo fighting game :)

We thought this was fitting the theme since:
 * The sumo ring is **round**
 * The sumo fighters are kinda **round**
 * Game mode is a best-of-three, so you have to win two **rounds**

Excluded warnings are described in the project README.
This game requires the terminal window to be fullscreen (or to reduce terminal font size enough to make it fit).
In testing we had a terrible experience with windows binaries, since they are run in the native windows terminal which seems to have a very low refresh rate. Launching the game from powershell from the newer Windows Terminal results in a much better experience.
